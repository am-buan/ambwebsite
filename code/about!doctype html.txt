	<p dir="ltr">Anna Buan (also known as me) is a film student based in the Chicago and Albuquerque areas with a focus on horror, sci-fi, coming of age, experimental, and documentary films (but really will make just about anything). I focus mainly on writing, but also have passion for illustration, directing, lighting, cinematography, and photography - and hope I will be able to work in all of these fields in various ways. In addition, I am an amateur comic creator as both an illustrator and writer.&nbsp;</p>
		<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
	<p dir="ltr"> At UNM, I work(ed) on short films such as: Jolanda (2023) as the director of photography and editor, Felinity (2024) as the second AC, Devil&rsquo;s Workshop (2023) in the art department, Waiting Room (2024) as a lighting grip, and Jasper Reed (2023) as the gaffer. My play &ldquo;Meat Cute&rdquo; also recently had a stage reading in the X theater at the Center for the Arts. I also work as a technical assistant for Adobe programming for the school.</p>

	<p dir="ltr"> I hope to create films, comics, and other such creative works. Here, there will be posts of film, photography, and comics. Creatively, I am working on scripts for feature films, a concept for a graphic novel series, and continuing to try and hone my crafts on sets. Other than that, I can probably be found playing video games, watching/ reading all sorts of films and books (I look down on no genre), at the gym, working on wildlife photography, hanging out with my friends and family, or stressing over coursework.</p>
