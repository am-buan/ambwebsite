	<p dir="ltr">I&rsquo;ve worked on a number of projects and have a lot of creative hobbies. Here&rsquo;s a look into some of what I&rsquo;ve worked on in the past, and what I may be able to do in the future.&nbsp;</p>
	<br>
<h2 style="textalign:center">FILMS</h2>
	<blockquote>
	  <p dir="ltr">Most of the short films I&rsquo;ve worked on are still in development, so here&rsquo;s a couple to watch in the meantime!&nbsp;</p>

	<blockquote>
	  <p>JOLANDA: A short documentary showing the life of a local New Mexican bead artist. I was the director of photography and editor for this. It won the Cherry Reel film festival at UNM in 2023.</p>

	<blockquote>
	  <p>REM Girl: A very, very horror short I did for fun over the summer. I wrote, directed, and edited this. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="textalign:center">ARTWORK</h2>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>A lot of my artwork has been inspired by comic artists - both classic and more recent artists - like George Pérez, Alex Ross, Jorge Jiménez, Joëlle Jones, and Travis G. Moore. Though I&rsquo;m not half as good as those artists, I hope to be able to convey character and emotion as well as they can now. (Left to Right): A knight with vines wrapped around her, a golden prince, another cool lady with a sword covered in blood, a render of two skeletons kissing, Medusa in her cave, and a study of lighting and colors with an angel. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="textalign:center">PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>I&rsquo;m more of a wildlife photographer than anything, but I will try to capture anything that catches my eye. Bugs, birds, and trees are my favorites!</p>
